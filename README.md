## Group Project
We created a BlackJack like game using python 3, including betting and dynamic graphics. First, it begins with a start screen. You then play against a dealer and can hit or stand. The buttons are interactive on screen, and you bet using the console, and it is displayed on screen. We are using replit to code and pygame to generate the graphics. The dealer will have a set AI, where it hits when it is 16 points or under, standing when above. You can see one of the dealer's cards and win, lose, or draw, tracking betting and money. You can continue until you run out of money.
