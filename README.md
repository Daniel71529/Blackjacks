## Group Project
We created a BlackJack like game using python 3, including betting and dynamic graphics. You play against a dealer and can bet or stand, and in special circumstances split. The buttons are interactive on screen, and you bet using the console, and it is displayed on screen. We are using replit to code and pygame to generate the graphics.
